# Introduction {.tabset}

The U.S. bike-sharing industry has experienced significant expansion,
revolutionizing urban mobility while addressing traffic congestion and
environmental sustainability. In major cities, accessible bike-sharing
networks are available, offering a variety of bike types including
traditional, electric, and smart bikes. Despite a few companies
dominating the market, there is room for unique differentiation.

A prominent example is Citi Bike NYC, operated by Lyft, which has
established itself as a key player in providing convenient, eco-friendly
transportation in New York since its inception in May 2013. Following
its success, Citi Bike expanded into Jersey City and Hoboken in 2015.
Our team is focused not only on increasing the overall usage of
bike-sharing in Jersey City but also on specifically promoting the use
of electric bikes. By emphasizing e-bikes, we aim to enhance the
sustainability and reputation of Citi Bike NYC, furthering its growth
and positive impact on urban transportation.

## Research question and approach

To enhance our understanding of the factors influencing the usage rate
of Citi Bike, our initial step involved identifying the key elements
contributing to the fluctuations in bike usage. A significant pivot in
Citi Bike's business model was the introduction of electric bikes
(E-bikes), which marked a notable change in the service's offerings.
Recognizing the potential of E-bikes to attract new users and increase
overall bike usage, we tailored our research questions to focus
specifically on this aspect.

Our primary research question is: **What is the optimal balance of
electric bikes and traditional bikes at Citi Bike stations across
various regions?** We structured our analytical framework to compare
E-bikes with traditional bikes in multiple dimensions. This comparison
aimed to shed light on user preferences, the impact of E-bikes on ride
duration, their role in expanding the user base to different
demographics, and the overall effect on the Citi Bike system's
efficiency and appeal. By concentrating on these comparative analyses,
we aimed to uncover insights that could guide strategies to boost Citi
Bike's usage rate effectively.

The first question we answered was: **what is the difference in top
popular routes for electric bikes versus traditional ones?** We define a
"route" as a distinct pair of start and end stations that define a
single trip. This approach will allow us to discern whether there are
particular patterns or preferences in the use of E-bikes versus
traditional bikes based on the routes users choose, thereby informing us
on how to optimally adjust the allocation of each bike type along the
routes.

To add depth to our analysis, we also plan to examine the distribution
of these popular routes across different days of the week. This aspect
of the research will provide insights into how the usage of E-bikes and
traditional bikes varies depending on the day. For instance, are certain
routes more popular with E-bike riders during weekdays as opposed to
weekends? Does the type of bike chosen correlate with the purpose of the
trip, such as commuting during weekdays or leisure activities during
weekends?

Our second research question delved into the **differences in the most
popular stations for electric bikes (E-bikes) versus traditional ones**.
Building on our analysis of popular routes, this inquiry extended to
examining how specific stations are utilized differently by E-bike and
traditional bike riders. In assessing the popularity of a station, we
employed a multifaceted approach, considering several key metrics:

1.  Total Inflow of Bikes: This metric involves counting the total
    number of bikes, both E-bikes and traditional, arriving at a
    station. This helps in understanding which stations serve as major
    destinations.

2.  Total Outflow of Bikes: Contrasting with inflow, this metric
    measures the total number of bikes leaving a station, providing
    insights into which stations are common starting points for trips.

3.  Net Change of Bikes Coming Into and Out of a Station: By calculating
    the difference between the inflow and outflow, we can identify
    stations that are net 'givers' or 'receivers' of bikes. This helps
    in understanding the dynamic balance of bike availability at each
    station.

4.  Cumulative Number of Bikes: This involves tracking the total number
    of bikes (both types) passing through a station over a given period,
    offering a broader view of station usage intensity.

## Results: Analysis & Recommendations

For this project we used trip data for the last 2 years, from October
2021 to October 2023.

```{r}

rides %>% filter(rideable_type != 'docked_bike') %>%
  mutate(ride_date = substr(as.character(ride_date), 1, 7)) %>%
  count(ride_date, rideable_type)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ride_date, y = n, group = rideable_type, color = rideable_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Year-Month", y = "Frequency", title = "Ride Counts by Rideable Type and Date") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) # This will rotate the x-axis labels

```

From the end of 2021 to the end of 2022 electric bike usage followed a
similar usage pattern as classic bikes in a lower magnitude. However,
since April 2023 the use of e-bikes has decreased, following an opposite
trend compared to the growth of classic bike usage.

On average, this is the distribution of ride type:

```{r}
df = 
rides %>%
  filter(rideable_type != 'docked_bike') %>%
  count(rideable_type) %>%
  rename(`Number of Rides` = n) %>%
  mutate(`Proportion of Rides` = round(100 * (`Number of Rides` / sum(`Number of Rides`)),1 ))

DT::datatable(df, rownames = FALSE)
```

Riders can pay for a subscription for unlimited bike rides, or they can
pay for individual rides.

```{r}
df =
rides %>%
  filter(rideable_type != 'docked_bike') %>%
  count(member_casual) %>%
  rename(`Number of Rides` = n) %>%
  mutate(`Proportion of Rides` = round(100 * (`Number of Rides` / sum(`Number of Rides`)),1 ))
DT::datatable(df, rownames = FALSE)
```

Members show a preference for classic bikes, with 70% of all classic
bike usage attributed to them, while non-members are more inclined
towards electric bikes, with members accounting for approximately 60% of
all e-bike usage.

```{r}

grouping_var = 'member_casual'  

rides %>% filter(rideable_type != 'docked_bike') %>%
  count(rideable_type, get(grouping_var)) %>%
  group_by(rideable_type) %>%
  mutate(total_count = sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(pct_type = 100 * n / total_count) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `get(grouping_var)`, y = pct_type, fill = rideable_type)) +
  #ggplot(aes(x = rideable_type, y = pct_type, fill = `get(grouping_var)`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(title = 'Proportion of rides by User', x = 'User Type', y = 'Rides (%)', fill = 'Ride Type') +
  theme_minimal()

```

##### **Type of bike and usage by different time frames**

While there is not a substantial difference in daily bike usage, a
higher number of bikes are utilized on weekdays compared to weekends.
Notably, Sunday sees the lowest bike usage. Overall, there is no
significant fluctuation in the daily usage pattern.

```{r}

grouping_var = 'ride_day'  

rides %>% filter(rideable_type != 'docked_bike') %>%
  count(rideable_type, get(grouping_var)) %>%
  group_by(rideable_type) %>%
  mutate(total_count = sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(pct_type = 100 * n / total_count) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `get(grouping_var)`, y = pct_type, fill = rideable_type)) +
  #ggplot(aes(x = rideable_type, y = pct_type, fill = `get(grouping_var)`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(title = 'Proportion of rides by Day of Week', x = 'Day of Week', y = 'Rides (%)', fill = 'Ride Type') +
  theme_minimal()

```

Bike usage reaches its peak between noon and evening (12 PM to 8 PM),
comprising almost 40% of overall activity. On the contrary, usage of
both classic and electric bikes is minimal during the night,
specifically from midnight (12 AM) to 6 AM, representing less than 5% of
total.

```{r}

grouping_var = 'ride_ToD'  

rides %>% filter(rideable_type != 'docked_bike') %>%
  count(rideable_type, get(grouping_var)) %>%
  group_by(rideable_type) %>%
  mutate(total_count = sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(pct_type = 100 * n / total_count) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `get(grouping_var)`, y = pct_type, fill = rideable_type)) +
  #ggplot(aes(x = rideable_type, y = pct_type, fill = `get(grouping_var)`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(title = 'Proportion of rides by Time of Day', x = 'Time of Day', y = 'Rides (%)', fill = 'Ride Type') +
  theme_minimal()

```

The usage patterns for both e-bikes and classic bikes are similar. In
the morning rush hour (7 AM to 8 AM), they account for 10% of daily bike
usage, while the evening rush hour (5 PM to 6 PM) sees a higher usage,
contributing to 20% of the day's total. Therefore, these two hours of
peak rush hour collectively represent 30% of the entire day's bike
usage.

```{r}

grouping_var = 'ride_peak'  

rides %>% filter(rideable_type != 'docked_bike') %>%
  count(rideable_type, get(grouping_var)) %>%
  group_by(rideable_type) %>%
  mutate(total_count = sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(pct_type = 100 * n / total_count) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `get(grouping_var)`, y = pct_type, fill = rideable_type)) +
  #ggplot(aes(x = rideable_type, y = pct_type, fill = `get(grouping_var)`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(title = 'Proportion of rides by Peak-Hour', x = 'Peak Hours', y = 'Rides (%)', fill = 'Ride Type') +
  theme_minimal()

```

##### **Type of bike and trips**

On average, rides in electric bikes are longer, both in terms of
distance and duration.

```{r}
df =
rides %>% filter(rideable_type != 'docked_bike') %>%
  group_by(rideable_type) %>%
  summarize(`Avg Distance (meters)` = round(mean(ride_dist_m, na.rm = TRUE)),
            `Avg Duration (minutes)` = round(mean(ride_dur_s, na.rm = TRUE) / 60, 1),
            #`Avg Speed` = round((`Avg Distance (meters)` / 1000) / (`Avg Duration (minutes)` / 60), 3)
            )
DT::datatable(df, rownames = FALSE)
```

The density graph depicting the distribution of ride distances (capped
at 5000 meters) for various bike types offers a clear perspective on the
average journey lengths associated with each type of bike. It's
noticeable that e-bikes typically have slightly longer riding distances
compared to classic bikes, with the most common distance being around
1000 meters. Moreover, the majority of rides, regardless of bike type,
do not exceed 2 kilometers. About 6% of rides start and end in the same
station, meaning the calculated distance is zero, which explains a
somewhat elevated density in 0. It's important to know that these rides
are made exclusively with regular bikes.

```{r}
hist_var = 'ride_dist_m'

rides %>% filter(rideable_type != 'docked_bike') %>%
  replace_na(list(hist_var = 0)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = get(hist_var), fill = rideable_type)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000)) +  # This is what I changed manually
  labs(title = 'Ride Distance Distribution for Ride Types', x = 'Ride Distance (meters)', y = 'density', fill = 'Ride Type') + 
  theme_minimal()
  
```

The density graph shows that e-bikes are typically ridden at faster
speeds than classic bikes. Most e-bike riders travel at speeds ranging
from 8 to 15 km/h, while the speed of classic bike riders mostly falls
between 5 to 12 km/h. It is also observed that very few bikes, whether
electric or classic, surpass the speed of 20 km/h.

```{r}
hist_var = 'ride_speed_kmh'

rides %>% filter(rideable_type != 'docked_bike') %>%
  replace_na(list(hist_var = 0)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = get(hist_var), fill = rideable_type)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 30)) +  # This is what I changed manually
  labs(title = 'Ride Speed Distribution for Ride Types', x = 'Ride Speed (km/h)', y = 'density', fill = 'Ride Type') + 
  theme_minimal()
```

#### **Recommendations based on dynamic application**

Based on our investigation results regarding the varying patterns of
e-bike and classic bike usage from different perspectives, we can
formulate recommendations for Citi Bike on optimizing the distribution
of these bike types.

***Tab 1: Routes***

Within the first tab of our dynamic application, named 'Routes,' we have
delineated the most popular routes taken by Citi Bike rides in Jersey
City on different weekdays, visually represented on a map. Users have
the option to select the number of most popular routes using a slider
and can choose the respective weekdays from the left side. The resulting
paths displayed on the map identifies high-demand stations. By analyzing
routes with high user traffic, Citi Bike could pinpoint stations along
these routes that consistently experience increased demand for bikes.
This approach provides our clients with insights into stations where
they should allocate a higher number of bikes along these popular routes
during different weekdays, considering their popularity. This strategic
allocation aims to reduce instances of bike shortages and increase the
efficiency of bike allocation in Jersey City.

The dynamic application outputs reveal distinct commuting patterns of
popular ride routes across various weekdays. From Monday to Thursday,
the most frequented route starts at Marin Light Rail and ends at Grove
St PATH, situated in the lower east part of Jersey City, with the
highest ride count recorded on Tuesday at 558 rides from Jul 2023 to Oct
2023. The result suggests a commuter-heavy route, likely utilized for
work commutes. Conversely, from Friday to Sunday, the most popular route
commences at Hoboken Terminal - Hudson St & Hudson Pl and ends at
Hoboken Ave at Monmouth St, located in the upper east part of Jersey
City, indicating potential leisure or weekend specific travels. The peak
usage is observed on Saturday, reaching 379 rides from Jul 2023 to Oct
2023.

The disparity between the routes during weekdays and weekends implies a
shift in rider behavior, with weekdays possibly focused on work commutes
and weekends geared towards leisurely activities or different
destinations. For routes starting from transportation hubs during
weekdays (Marin Light Rail, Grove St PATH), it indicate commuter-heavy
areas, while routes starting from different locations during
weekends(Hoboken Terminal) suggest travel to recreational destinations.

| Most Frequented Route (Weekdays)                                                                                                                                                                  | Most Frequented Route (Weekend)                                                                                                                                                                   |

Based on the specific usage patterns observed, we recommend Citi Bike
strategically allocate additional bikes during peak times along
commuter-heavy routes, notably from Marin Light Rail to Grove St PATH on
weekdays, ensuring ample supply, particularly on Tuesdays. Considering
the relatively short route distance, Citi Bike could consider allocating
more classic bikes at these stations. For weekends, focusing on
increased bike availability around Hoboken Terminal would accommodate
riders exploring recreational areas. Given the longer route distance,
Citi Bike could consider allocating more e-bikes at stations along this
route. Moreover, implementing targeted promotions in these areas to
enhance social awareness, along with enhancing bike infrastructure along
these popular paths, would significantly enhance user experiences.

***Tab 2: Stations***

In the second tab of our dynamic application named 'Stations,' a
graphical representation showcases the locations of all stations in
Jersey City. This tab shows the number of bikes entering and exiting
each station daily, the net change per day, and cumulatively tracks bike
movements over the selected time period. You choose to view ebike or
classic bike on any given date. This tab provides a visualization of the
exact locations of stations on a map, enabling our client, Citi Bike, to
monitor the daily traffic at each station.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wnRD0W7NPA_SNXuFnudyouaFaC9yuOX8BL8pV9ZbTVTfWY-4xH8RTyWObgDtvPgcpzvqgIg69S8fUtsdrgGx8W0urdRkRb5iPfeE8v1vXOLg0wDiPCy1lWgnpOTcRP-m6gIpQq5U8iijsZEADkZAEBY){width="172"}

Notably, the net change of a bike station is calculated using four
metrics, which involve subtracting the number of bikes that leave a
station (bike out) from the number that arrive (bike in). A negative net
change indicates a shortage of bikes at that station, while a positive
number suggests a surplus. 

Most stations typically experience single-digit bike inflow and outflow,
but stations near PATH hubs like Hoboken and Grove Street often see
two-digit figures in bike traffic. These areas are evidently busier than
others, indicating a higher demand for bike services. Notably, the
Hoboken station is the busiest, primarily due to its role as a major
PATH station for New Jersey residents commuting to New York. In the
vicinity of Hoboken, there are four closely situated bike stations.
Despite their proximity - just a block apart - some stations experience
significantly different rates of bike inflow and outflow.

Considering the information provided, we recommend that Citi Bike
utilize this tab to gain a clearer understanding of bike usage patterns.
This insight will assist in optimizing the distribution of bikes
throughout Jersey City, with a particular focus on stations experiencing
higher levels of bike inflow and outflow.

***Tab 3: E-bikes / Classic bikes***

In the third tab of the dynamic application, named 'E-bikes / Classic
bikes,' we illustrate the change in the number of bikes leaving the
station on selected weekdays. Users can select bike types and weekdays
on the upper left side, followed by choosing specific station markers
displayed on the map. The resulting outcome is presented as a plotted
graph, displaying the average numbers of bikes leaving the station
during different hours of the day.

Our visualization of the average number of e-bikes leaving the station
offers insights into peak hours of bike usage, aiding in strategic
resource allocation. Simultaneously, identifying stations experiencing
higher bike outflow during specific hours provides opportunities to
increase bike stock and promote the usage of e-bikes at those stations
to avoid shortages and raise customer awareness.

The graph below illustrates the average number of e-bikes departing from
the Marin Light Rail station, previously identified as the most
frequented starting point on workdays, particularly on Tuesdays. It
reveals peak hours for e-bike outflow at this station around 8 am and 6
pm, aligning with rider behavior analyzed in the 'Routes' section. The
highest outflow, approximately 8 bikes, occurs at 8 am, followed by a
significant drop to an outflow of 2.5 bikes around 9 am, suggesting a
potential shortage in e-bikes post-peak commuting hours.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/M-5HBOyO1XNvPfLAtax4YyaeUf_-ydknwqo0RlGrkIkuZWm0E-XBJO0qhmRn5Lvr_p6VreHBTDW9hwLOM9DdhfMnUXYUCPla4_z6CNaQ-1dLP9NeQnTf3nYnToXef6aGxCqU3yfmWdFm6tUOUWUW460){width="435"}\
\
Based on these findings, we recommend that Citi Bike increase e-bike
inventory at popular stations during peak commuting hours (8 am and 6
pm) on workdays to meet heightened demand and prevent shortages
afterward. Leveraging the functionality in the third tab enables Citi
Bike to identify hotspot stations. Considering this, Citi Bike could
contemplate expanding or upgrading these stations to ensure sufficient
e-bike availability, battery charging facilities, and parking spaces
during peak hours. Additionally, conducting rider awareness programs at
these hotspots to educate riders about e-bike availability and their
advantages would further enhance user experiences.

***Tab 4: Grouping Variables***

In our 'Grouping Variables' tab, the count of e-bike and classic bike
rides is depicted in the resulting plot. Users can select the grouping
variables from the options provided on the upper left side. The ride
counts can be grouped by a single date, a single month, every weekday,
or every weekend. The count of classic bikes is represented by the red
line, while the count of e-bikes is indicated by the blue line. 

![](images/Sin%20título.jpg)

This tab provides Citi Bike with essential insights into rider behavior
and usage patterns across different time measures. Through the
visualization, Citi Bike gains a comprehensive understanding of daily,
monthly, and weekly trends, which is essential for resource optimization
by identifying usage patterns.

***Tab 5: Density Plot***

Our latest density tab offers three variable selections, allowing our
customers to visualize the density plot of riding duration in seconds,
riding distance in meters, and riding speed in km/h. In this
representation, classic bikes are depicted in red, while e-bikes are
shown in blue.

![](images/Sin%20título-1.jpg)

As observed in our dynamic application, e-bikes tend to exhibit higher
speeds and cover longer distances and durations. This tab provides a
visual representation for users to compare how customers ride these two
different types of bikes in the city.
